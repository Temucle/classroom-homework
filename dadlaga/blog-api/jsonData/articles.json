    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> recovered from an 0-12 start on Overpass to secure victory in the series, 2-1.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> booked a spot in the semi-final of IEM Katowice after surpassing <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> in the opening round of the playoffs. The North American side had one of the worst starts to the series imaginable, losing twelve rounds straight on their map pick of Overpass, but showed mental resilience and came alive on their own CT side to claim an unprecedented win on the map before later closing out the series on the Mirage decider.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> No team on LAN has ever recovered from an 0-12 deficit on Overpass. Sangal is the only team to <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/146761/ungentium-vs-sangal?startDate=2022-11-10&amp;endDate=2022-11-15&amp;maps=de_overpass\"><strong>have done so previously in an online event</strong></a>.</p></blockquote><p>The victory puts <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> through to the semi-final, where they will take on an invincible-looking <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5995/g2\"><strong>G2</strong></a>. The European squad has been on a tear since returning from the tournament break, and is currently on a 17-map win streak⁠ — tied for the third-longest streak in CS:GO LAN history.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/news/35576/can-anyone-stop-g2-at-iem-katowice\"><img src=\"https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/8Zt7a3OAec6Ya_cWroIbRa.jpg?auto=compress&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=107&amp;mx=20&amp;my=473&amp;q=75&amp;w=800&amp;s=1ac82b74b398d3e11ca0cb74d2fda34b\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/news/35576/can-anyone-stop-g2-at-iem-katowice\">Read more</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/news/35576/can-anyone-stop-g2-at-iem-katowice\"><strong>Can anyone stop G2 at IEM Katowice?</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/7322/apex\"><strong>Dan \"⁠apEX⁠\" Madesclaire</strong></a>'s side will be kicking themselves after letting such a lead slip, especially given their performance on map two, a blowout victory on Nuke which could have ended the series 2-0 if they had taken Overpass over the line. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> had failed to make the playoffs at IEM Katowice in all of their prior appearances, so while making it through this time around can be considered progress, the heartbreaking fashion that their elimination came about in will still leave them immensely disappointed as they leave Poland.</p><p><picture><source srcset=\"https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/tdSnFwvJiPdDzmpy_t4prT.jpg?auto=compress&amp;fm=avif&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=107&amp;mx=20&amp;my=473&amp;q=75&amp;w=800&amp;s=4bdd1f09755967a68a9765bd7e7898d1 1x, https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/tdSnFwvJiPdDzmpy_t4prT.jpg?auto=compress&amp;fm=avif&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=213&amp;mx=39&amp;my=947&amp;q=75&amp;w=1600&amp;s=d0d5d80b612fea07d35a2687b519a0d4 2x\" type=\"image/avif\"><img src=\"https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/tdSnFwvJiPdDzmpy_t4prT.jpg?auto=compress&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=107&amp;mx=20&amp;my=473&amp;q=75&amp;w=800&amp;s=2e23f7942a6bc7c872b0a81992c2e045\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://img-cdn.hltv.org/gallerypicture/tdSnFwvJiPdDzmpy_t4prT.jpg?auto=compress&amp;ixlib=java-2.1.0&amp;m=%2Fm.png&amp;mw=213&amp;mx=39&amp;my=947&amp;q=75&amp;w=1600&amp;s=f74eb16c539581054f7329577b15bbfb 2x\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture></p><p>Liquid will face G2 on Saturday for a spot in the grand final</p><p>T-side rounds would be desolate throughout the entirety of Overpass in this series, and that fact was made quite evident quite early on. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> struggled immensely to find entry onto bombsites on their map pick, unable to find an answer to <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a>'s proactive defense, and those two factors combined to leave the North American side down by a substantial margin in the first half. With <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/18221/spinx\"><strong>Lotan \"⁠Spinx⁠\" Giladi</strong></a> patrolling bathrooms and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/9032/magisk\"><strong>Emil \"⁠Magisk⁠\" Reif</strong></a>'s aggression tearing apart <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> outside of monster, <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> reigned supreme, amassing an uncontested 12-0 lead to kick off the map.</p><p>The French-Danish combine looked indomitable, sitting upon a lead on Overpass that no team had ever squandered before on LAN. That was a stat line that would change once <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> got the ball rolling on the CT-side, heading into their defensive effort with just two rounds to their name that were garnered right at the end of the half. Immense efforts from <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/8738/elige\"><strong>Jonathan \"⁠EliGE⁠\" Jablonowski</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/13249/osee\"><strong>Josh \"⁠oSee⁠\" Ohm</strong></a> proved key in mounting that comeback effort, several advantageous situations being squandered by <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> as <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> slowly clawed their way back. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/7322/apex\"><strong>apEX</strong></a>'s side had their opponents up against the ropes for much of the half, leading 15-7, but couldn't close things out and ended up faltering in overtime as <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> claimed victory 19-17.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/11893/zywoo\"><strong>Mathieu \"⁠ZywOo⁠\" Herbaut</strong></a> came alive on <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a>'s pick of Nuke, scoring a 1vs2 clutch to help enable a 6-1 start to the map for his team. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> showed signs of life toward the latter portion of the first half and clawed back to post six rounds of their own, but their efforts on the map proved fruitless as <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> put up a stalwart defense in the second half to swiftly bring the map to an end, 16-7.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mirage was a much more back-and-forth affair, although it didn't begin as such. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> were unrelenting in their attack and picked apart <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a>'s defenses round after round, with the European combine continuing to falter in a handful of late-round situations despite having an advantage. Early trading of rounds gave way to <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> running away with the lead, 9-4, and the map looked to be rapidly approaching its conclusion with <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> seeming to have run out of steam after an incredible last-second round win from <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/8520/naf\"><strong>Keith \"⁠NAF⁠\" Markovic</strong></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heroics from <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/18221/spinx\"><strong>Spinx</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/11893/zywoo\"><strong>ZywOo</strong></a> gave their side some breathing room as they added two rounds to their tally, and though they fumbled the second half pistol round after the side swap, a force-buy allowed them to answer right back and turn the momentum in their favor. They rallied back to a 9-10 deficit before <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> got back on the horse, multi-kill rounds from <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/8520/naf\"><strong>NAF</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/8738/elige\"><strong>EliGE</strong></a> helping the North Americans maintain their lead, only for <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/9032/magisk\"><strong>Magisk</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/18221/spinx\"><strong>Spinx</strong></a> to answer with two rounds of their own to keep the teams within one round of each other. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> again pulled ahead by two rounds, 14-11, but it looked as if <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> would swing control of the map into their favor again when <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/player/7398/dupreeh\"><strong>Peter \"⁠dupreeh⁠\" Rasmussen</strong></a> picked up a crucial ace to grant his side 12 rounds. <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/9565/vitality\"><strong>Vitality</strong></a> failed to convert off such a momentous round win, however, and <a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/team/5973/liquid\"><strong>Liquid</strong></a> quickly seized the opportunity to close out the map from there, 16-12.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hltv.org/events/6809/iem-katowice-2023\">IEM Katowice 2023</a><br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>As Japan's prime minister names his pick for the new head of the country's central bank, it is clear that the job comes with some major challenges.</strong></p><p>The latest figures published by the government show the economy is recovering from the pandemic at a far slower pace than expected.</p><p>At the same time prices are rising at the fastest rate in more than 40 years.</p><p>So what can the academic Kazuo Ueda do to fix the world's third largest economy?</p><p>If approved by the country's parliament as the next governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), Mr Ueda has to deal with both slow economic growth and the highest inflation since 1981.</p><p>On Tuesday, official figures for the last three months of 2022 showed Japan's economy expanded by 0.6%, much lower than forecasts of 2% growth.</p><p>Meanwhile, data for December showed core consumer prices rose by 4% from a year earlier, twice the rate targeted by the central bank.</p><p>Experts warn that the next governor of the BOJ will struggle to raise interest rates to curb inflation without harming fragile economic growth.</p><p>The main reason for this is that prices in the country have been pushed up by external factors, like the war in Ukraine, rather than by the strength of the economy.</p><p>\"If you try to tighten policy to address bad inflation that Japan is seeing right now, that runs the risk of setting you back in your own efforts to generate good inflation,\" Stefan Angrick of Moody's Analytics told the BBC.</p><p>When reports surfaced last week that Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida would nominate Mr Ueda to replace Haruhiko Kuroda, who has been in the role for a decade, it took investors by surprise.</p><p>Although an academic by training, Mr Ueda is not a complete stranger to the central bank. He was a BOJ policy board member between 1998 and 2005.</p><p>He was at the central bank in 1999 when it introduced the unconventional policy of cutting the cost of borrowing to zero in an attempt to boost the country's economy.</p><p>However, Mr Ueda was not at the BOJ when it implemented its controversial policy of putting a cap on the interest rates paid on government bonds.</p><p>While the policy known as yield curve control (YCC) has little direct impact on ordinary consumers, investors have been pressuring the central bank to ditch it as they were seeing returns on their investments shrinking.</p><p>Last week, financial markets welcomed reports of Mr Ueda's nomination, as he was seen as more likely than other potential candidates to scrap the policy.</p><p>While the challenges faced by the next governor of the BOJ may be daunting, Mr Ueda is seen by some as a pragmatist who will be able to adapt to the changing economic landscape.</p><p>\"He is not a man of dogma, but one of science; a deep and creative thinker who is not afraid to test his hypothesis in the real world,\" economist Jesper Koll said in a report.</p><p>\"He is thoughtful, he does not shoot from the hip, and will be seeking to design an optimal sustainable policy framework rather than looking for big, quick wins.\"</p>",
